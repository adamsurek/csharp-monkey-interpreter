## Writing an Interpreter in C#

### Project Purpose

This project is based on Thorsten Ball's [Writing an Interpreter in Go](https://interpreterbook.com/) and aims to provide
me with a better understanding in the following areas:

- How interpreters work, as well as its fundamental components (lexers, parsers, etc.)
- Unit testing and Test Driven Development
- C# and .Net
