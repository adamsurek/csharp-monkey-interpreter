## Writing an Interpreter in C#

### WORK IN PROGRESS

### Project Purpose

This project is based on Thorsten Ball's [Writing an Interpreter in Go](https://interpreterbook.com/) and aims to provide
me with a better understanding in the following areas:

- How interpreters work, as well as its fundamental components (lexers, parsers, etc.)
- Unit testing and Test Driven Development
- Object-oriented programming
- C# and .NET
- Golang

### Development Process

My intention while working on this project is to follow the book as it's written to get the interpreter in a completely 
functional state. When I have completed the book, I intend to revisit how the project is structured, rethink some of the 
book's design decisions to align with standard C#/.Net program design, and further tune the interpreter.
